Hello There!
My name is Daniel Kindl. Nickname Tangorock.
I am 18 years old and currently studing Computing Science in Czech republic.
My goals are to be an expert in Python, C# and Web Developing. These are my long-term goals. But you never know!

Here, at github.com I'll be posting my project that will be open-source to anyone who likes technology and programming same as me. Or even more!
